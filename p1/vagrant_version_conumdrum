Face with the subject requirement of using the last
stable release of my OS of choice(alpine) and the
requirement of following modern standars and good
practices from the subject for vagrant, that implies
using trusted sources as vagrant cloud for downloading
the images.

I decided to go with the latest version on vagrant
cloud 3.18 of alpine, and not the latest of alpine
on the alpine page, 3.22, since that would break
the good practices, and i am getting the latest stable
version i am allowed to between those constrains.

Leaving this as a memory, since probably i won't
remember anything by the time the evaluation is up
